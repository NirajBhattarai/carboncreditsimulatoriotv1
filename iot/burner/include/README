This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include`.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that includes it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With the include mechanism, a change in a header file does
not require that the project source files be changed.
